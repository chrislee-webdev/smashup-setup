# smashup-setup

This is my attempt to create am automated game set up for the board game Smash Up. Users will be able to select the number of players and the expansions that they would like to include in their game. Once the players have gone through their selections, they can click on the "Start Game" button an the app will assign faction based on the number of player and the expansions that they have selected.
